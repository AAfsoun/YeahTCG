Planned Features:

make safari work (scrollbars??)
improve client code to work on old browsers
sacrifice to play system
make it so people see buffness of cards
Balance goal cards reasonably
Implement card with the Charlemagne-Jackson image
Implement card with name 'involuntary flex'
Implement goal card which makes it so if you win, you lose and vice versa
Implement card which has you and your opponent swap positions (Hand only? Play only? Everything?)
Fully implement Power of the Church
Implement Kiss of Death (select cards based on RP
Implement Total Annihilation (random)

Bugs:
response cards mess up damage stuff
make get_card/get_text more secure (re-ask if response doesn't match format)
attacking broken?
choose card gets broken if packet doesn't get through
Go through every card and make the phrasing consistent/better

Sir Lancelot triggers on attack and it's only supposed to do it on play.
Defending a 3rp card with a 5rp sweaty homunculus crashed game (can't replicate?)
Voce Nao crashes game when used against buff jaycob
when a card seems to be destroyed, but it's not because of a response card, then its activation is messed up

card would be destroyed
special play card
direct damage
activate unit card
declare attack
