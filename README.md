Yeah_TCG
==============
Yeah_TCG is a digitized, online version of a two-player card game made for a school project. Players take turns choosing cards to attack and defend. Players win by satsifying one of their goal cards, or when their opponent runs out of health or cards in their deck. Complete rules for the in-person version of this game are given in the file rules.docx.
